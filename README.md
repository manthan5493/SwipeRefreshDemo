# SwipeRefreshDemo

Have you ever used Twitter, Google+ or Gmail Application in your device?

Yes?

Then you might have noticed that when we pull down on the app screen, all of the screen’s feed gets refreshed. Now, would you like to add this feature in your app?

Absolutely, right?

Don’t worry, I’ve written [a tutorial article] (https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-tutorial-implement-pull-to-refresh-android/) for the same. In which, I’ve explained the step-by-step process of adding pull down to refresh feature.

This is what I always wanted to learn and after join Space-O Technologies - [A Mobile App Development Company] (http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/mobile-app-development/), I had a project in which adding pull down to refresh feature was required. And, I found the best way to do it. So here, I’m sharing one demo to help you guys understand how to add ‘Pull down to Refresh’ feature in your own native Android app.
